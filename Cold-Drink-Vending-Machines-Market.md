While demand remains strong, new challenges, such as environmental concerns and the increasing preference for sustainable solutions, are expected to drive market evolution. Major factors influencing demand over the next decade include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Sustainability Focus:</strong> As consumers become more environmentally conscious, the demand for energy-efficient and eco-friendly machines will rise.
