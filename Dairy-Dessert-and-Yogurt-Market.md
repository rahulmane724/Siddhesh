Plant-based yogurt will see particularly high growth rates.</li> <li><strong>Latin America:</strong> Increasing disposable income and a shift towards healthier eating will spur growth, especially in countries like Brazil and Mexico.</li></ul><h2>Statistical Insights and Projections</h2><p>The dairy dessert and yogurt market was valued at approximately <strong>$80 billion in 2022</strong> and is projected to grow at a CAGR of <strong>5.2%</strong> over the next decade.
